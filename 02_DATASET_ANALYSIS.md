- **Modality**: Bimodal (peaks at ~$20K public, ~$45K private)
- **Skewness**: +0.82 (moderately right-skewed)
- **Kurtosis**: 2.91 (slightly platykurtic)

### Quality Score Distribution
- **Distribution Type**: Approximately normal
- **Skewness**: +0.23 (slightly right-skewed)
- **Kurtosis**: 2.87 (mesokurtic, close to normal)

## Data Limitations

### Known Constraints
1. **US Only**: No international universities included
2. **Minimum Size**: Excludes universities < 1,000 students
3. **4-Year Focus**: Associates-degree-only institutions excluded
4. **Single Year**: Cross-sectional data (2023 only)
5. **Missing Metrics**: Not all universities have complete quality data

### Potential Biases
1. **Size Bias**: Larger universities overrepresented
2. **Geographic Bias**: Some states have more universities than others
3. **Reporting Bias**: Universities may selectively report favorable metrics
4. **Selection Bias**: Government data may exclude certain institution types

## Data Preprocessing Steps

### Cleaning Operations Applied
1. **Outlier Detection**: Identified and verified extreme values
2. **Missing Data Handling**: Required minimum 5/9 quality metrics
3. **Standardization**: Normalized all quality metrics to 0-100 scale
4. **Validation**: Cross-checked institutional names and locations
5. **Deduplication**: Ensured no duplicate university entries

### Quality Control Measures
- **Range Validation**: All prices $1K-$100K, all scores 0-100
- **Logical Consistency**: Admission rates 0-1, graduation rates 0-1
- **Cross-validation**: Spot-checked 50 universities against official websites
- **Statistical Validation**: Identified and investigated statistical outliers

## Dataset Strengths
